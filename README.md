- A game of charades.
- Made with Google Code Labs
- MVVM
- LiveData

## This app uses Android Architecture Components
 - UI Controller: 
 A UI controller is a UI-based class such as Activity or Fragment. A UI controller should only contain logic that handles UI and operating-system interactions such as displaying views and capturing user input. Don't put decision-making logic, such as logic that determines the text to display, into the UI controller.

 - ViewModel:
 A ViewModel holds data to be displayed in a fragment or activity associated with the ViewModel. A ViewModel can do simple calculations and transformations on data to prepare the data to be displayed by the UI controller. In this architecture, the ViewModel performs the decision-making.

 - ViewModel Factory:
 A viewModel Factory instantiates ViewModel objects, with or without constructor parameters. A factory method is a method that returns an instance of the same class.

 - LiveData:
 LiveData lets you build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes. To use the LiveData class, you set up "observers" (for example, activities or fragments) that observe changes in the app's data. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, so it only updates app-component observers that are in an active lifecycle state. LiveData is observable, which means that an observer is notified when the data held by the LiveData object changes. LiveData holds data; LiveData is a wrapper that can be used with any data. LiveData is lifecycle-aware. When you attach an observer to the LiveData, the observer is associated with a LifecycleOwner (usually an Activity or Fragment).

### UI controller
- An example of a UI controller is the ScoreFragment that you created in this codelab.
- Doesn't contain any data to be displayed in the UI.
- Contains code for displaying data, and user-event code such as click listeners.
- Destroyed and re-created during every configuration change.
- Contains views.
- Contains a reference to the associated ViewModel.

### ViewModel
- An example of a ViewModel is the ScoreViewModel that you created in this codelab.
- Contains data that the UI controller displays in the UI.
- Contains code for data processing.
- Destroyed only when the associated UI controller goes away permanentlyâ€”for an activity, when the activity finishes, or for a fragment, when the fragment is detached.
- Should never contain references to activities, fragments, or views, because they don't survive configuration changes, but the ViewModel does.
- Doesn't contain any reference to the associated UI controller.
